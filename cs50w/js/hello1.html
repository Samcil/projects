            // With the intro of JS we can do what we call event driven programming
            // i.e. we run certain operations only when the user triggers an event
            // to do this, we wrap our operations in functions and call them when that event is triggered
            // First way to do this is by putting this function as attributes within html tags
            // Create a function to manipulate the dom of the document BY checking what the innerhtml is using conditionals
            function hello() {
                // We can store elements of the document in a variable
