            // With the intro of JS we can do what we call event driven programming
            // i.e. we run certain operations only when the user triggers an event
            // to do this, we wrap our operations in functions and call them when that event is triggered
            // First way to do this is by putting this function as attributes within html tags
            // 
            let counter = 0;
            function count() {
                counter++;

            // This would fail because, the script will be read from top to bottom and since the button element
            //is only created after calling the function, nothing will happen when the button is clicked.
            // TO SOLVE THIS, WE USE ANOTHER PROPERTY IN THE DOM which runs the function only when all html is loaded

            document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function (){
                // Eventlistener takes in two inputs, the event to listen for and the function to apply when event is triggered
                document.querySelector('button').onclick = count;
