            // i.e. we run certain operations only when the user triggers an event
            // to do this, we wrap our operations in functions and call them when that event is triggered
            // First way to do this is by putting this function as attributes within html tags
            // 
            let counter = 0;

            // This would fail because, the script will be read from top to bottom and since the button element
            //is only created after calling the function, nothing will happen when the button is clicked.
