<!-- Microsoft Edge bing response on what HTML elements are -->
<!-- An HTML element is a fundamental building block within an HTML document. It defines the structure and content of a web page. Let’s break down what an HTML element consists of: -->

<!-- Start Tag: An HTML element begins with a start tag, which is enclosed in angle brackets (< and >). The start tag specifies the type of element and any associated attributes. For example: -->
<h1>: Represents a top-level heading.
<p>: Represents a paragraph.
<!-- Content: The content of the element comes after the start tag. It can include text, other nested elements, or both. For instance: -->
<h1>My First Heading</h1>: The content here is “My First Heading.”
<p>My first paragraph.</p>: The content is “My first paragraph.”
<!-- End Tag: Every HTML element has an end tag, which also uses angle brackets but includes a forward slash (</). The end tag marks the end of the element. Examples: -->
</h1>: Closes the heading element.
</p>: Closes the paragraph element.
<!-- Nested Elements: HTML elements can be nested within each other. This means an element can contain other elements. For instance:
HTML -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>My First Heading</h1>
    <p>My first paragraph.</p>
  </body>
</html>
<!-- AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ. -->
Here, the <html> element contains the <body> element, which in turn contains the <h1> and <p> elements.
<!-- Empty Elements: Some elements have no content and are called empty elements. They don’t require an end tag. For example: -->
<br>: Represents a line break.
<img>: Displays an image.
<!-- Remember that HTML tags are not case-sensitive, although it’s recommended to use lowercase tags for consistency. So, <p> and <P> are equivalent, but lowercase is preferred. Always include the end tag to ensure proper rendering, even if some elements appear to work without it. -->

<!-- In summary, HTML elements define the structure, semantics, and visual representation of web content, allowing browsers to interpret and display it appropriately. 🌐📝 -->
